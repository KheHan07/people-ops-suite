# **<font color="#FF7300">WSO2</font> Sales Meeting Scheduler User Guide**

<br>

## **Purpose**

The purpose is to **centralize sales meeting recordings** in a single location. This enables leads to provide feedback and ensures that Team Organizers (TOs) and others who join the conversation later are up to date, thus maintaining continuity in discussions. Currently, recordings are stored in the individual host's drive, making access inconvenient for others. Using a common user account to schedule sales meetings would ensure all recordings are stored in one shared drive. This would make it easier for leads to review calls and provide feedback, and for other team members (such as Solution Architects and Customer Success Managers) to catch up on previous discussions before joining.

<br>

## **Overview**

The <a href="https://meet.wso2.com" target="_blank">WSO2 Sales Meeting Scheduler</a> is a homegrown app created by the WSO2 DigiOps for the Sales Team. It was created to address the issues mentioned above and ensure that all sales call recordings are stored in a **centralized location**.

<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The **Meeting Title** will be automatically generated based on the selected meeting type and the customer name entered. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The format will be: **Meeting Type - Customer Name - [Your Input in the Title Box]** (e.g., **Discovery Call - Areeba - Test**, as shown in the screenshot). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This helps maintain a consistent naming convention. You can use the Title box to add any additional details to be included, or leave it blank if you prefer.
